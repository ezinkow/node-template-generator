## About This Project:

This is a team template generator that outputs team member profile cards based on answers given to questions in the command line.

This was built with HTML, Javascript, Inquirer, and fs 

## Summary of Project:

This is a backend program where the programmer/user types "node app.js" in the command line. The user is then given a list of questions, like name, email, title. Title is a list of options, either manager, engineer, or intern. Based on this answer, the user is then given a question specific to the role/title. When done entering in all team members, a new HTML page is created called "team.html" that displays each team member's profile cards.
